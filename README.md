Hello!🧑‍💻 You can find here the documents and resources used for the LaTeX for Linguists Workshop co-organised with the St John's LingSoc and CamTeX. 

Part of this workshop was based on a previous one given by Brandon Papineau and Nina Markl at ULAB's 2021 Annual Conference. We encourage to check it out here https://github.com/BranPap/LaTeX_for_Linguists.
